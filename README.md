# SAMP-Speedometer-Filterscript

You will need a few includes to run it properly (You can find them on the internet and the links are in the .pwn file)
Also dont forget to create a directory in your scriptfiles folder, otherwise your server will crash.
The speedometer is not entirly made by myself, it uses a lot of code from other people of the internet, credit goes to them (I cant remember who)
